## Results
### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights**
#### **Data Overview:**
- The dataset contains multiple columns with structured data.
- Identified numerical and categorical features.

#### **Missing Values:**
- Some columns have missing values, handled via imputation or removal.

#### **Data Distribution:**
- Visualized distributions of numerical columns using histograms.
- Categorical data analyzed with bar plots to understand value frequencies.

#### **Correlation Analysis:**
- Heatmaps and correlation matrices used to find relationships between variables.
- Strong correlations noted between certain features, indicating potential multicollinearity.

#### **Outlier Detection:**
- Boxplots and IQR methods used to identify outliers.
- Decision made whether to remove or retain outliers based on domain relevance.

#### **Feature Engineering:**
- Created new features based on domain knowledge to enhance model performance.
- Converted categorical variables using encoding techniques.

### **Sentiment Analysis Insights**
#### **Sentiment Distribution:**
- The dataset was analyzed for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
